So far this repository contains the following:

* Formalization of Gardam's disproof of the unit conjecture.
* A replication in __lean 4__ of some of the __scala__ code used in the _PolyMath 14_ project. 

However the branch `unit-conjecture` (whose README this is) has only the formalization of Gardam's disproof of the unit conjecture.
