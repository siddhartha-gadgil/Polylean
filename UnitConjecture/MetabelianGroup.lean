## Metabelian groups

Metabelian groups are group extensions `1 → K → G → Q → 1` with both the kernel and the quotient Abelian.
Such an extension is determined by data:

* a group action of `Q` on `K` by automorphisms
* a cocyle `c: Q → Q → K`

We define the cocycle condition and construct a group structure on a structure extending `K × Q`.
The main step is to show that the cocyle condition implies associativity.
