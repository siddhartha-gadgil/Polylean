  A two-complex is defined in terms of two pieces of data:
  - An underlying 1-complex, which is a `Quiver` (or `SerreGraph`)
  - A groupoid, whose morphisms represent the path-homotopy classes of the 1-complex
  - A `PreFunctor` from the `Quiver` to the `Groupoid`, sending each edge of the quiver to its path-homotopy class 
    (this pre-functor has a natural extension to the path category of the quiver)
  
  A further requirement is that the groupoid does not contain any "extra" edges, i.e., that the pre-functor is surjective.
  This can be re-stated in the form of a "recursion principle" that allows certain maps from the quiver to lift to maps from the groupoid.
